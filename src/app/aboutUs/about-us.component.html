    <span class="cl-fnt-01">Why We Started Savorly</span>
    <span class="alg-pg-fs">The idea for Savorly came to us at our own dinner table. It was yet another amazing meal prepared by the best cook in the world—Mom. As we were finishing up, an interesting thought started working its way around the dining room: “Wouldn’t it be great if other people could taste Mom’s food? What if she opened her own little food business, right from our kitchen?”<br/><br/>

        We knew we weren’t alone. ‘Moms’ exists across the world, cooking up the best homemade dishes you never knew about. We created Savorly to introduce ‘Mom’ to the world, and the world to ‘Mom.’</span>
